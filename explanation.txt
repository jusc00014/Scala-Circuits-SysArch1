Problem 2.2
	jal:
	 - Decoder
	 - Control_signals: Add ALU for NEXT_PC_SELECT
	 - RV32I_ExecutionUnit: Define what to do with the pc if ALU is selected
	 - ControlUnit: Need only one cycle, write pc+4 to rd, use ALU to compute pc = pc+imm
	jalr:
	 - Decoder
	 - ControlUnit: Need only one cycle, write pc+4 to rd, use ALU to compute pc = rs1+imm and set last bit to 0
	 
	 
Problem 2.3
	- Decoder: Decodes according to I-Type
	- ControlUnit: Need multiple cycles, write ALU-result to reg, activate data request, data_be similar to STORE OP
